# GERMANcREDIT
A DATA Science project which helps in analysing that a person can get loan or not, operated on german credit dataset found on UCI epository.
Cleaning of the Dataset
The Dataset has around 10 columns and 1000 observations or rows. It contained a lot of
missing values which were removed using na.omit function and the observations reduced to
almost half. Some columns required labeling in numeric, it was also done .

Data Modelling
Linear regression was applied , after reducing and limiting the dataset by observing and
finding out the relationship among the dataset. Mutation on dataset was done after that.
Applying ETL and plotting graphs was the last step of the project.
Different types of Plots were between related attributes for the better understanding of the
data.
